3D skeletons are crucial for biomedical image analysis, from neuron tracing to blood vessel centerline prediction. However, due to significant variations in appearance and morphology of objects of interest, there are few frameworks to predict 3D instance skeletons robustly for different imaging domains.

In this thesis, we propose an end-to-end trainable method called {\it Flux-and-Track} to tackle this challenge. Our method first extends a flux-based semantic skeleton prediction network for 3D data to obtain semantic skeleton prediction. Then, we use an instance proposal module to generate over-split skeleton of all object instances that are later agglomerated by a recurrent tracking network.

We quantitatively evaluate our method on two kinds of benchmark datasets: neural skeletons from electron microscopy and synthetic blood vessels, and qualitatively evaluate on a third brain MRA dataset. We show that our method consistently achieves better results.
