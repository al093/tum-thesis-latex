\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

We developed an instance skeletonization method for 3D biomedical images and showed its efficacy on different modalities. We demonstrated the use of topology of skeletons to resolve false merges and splits leading to better connectivity and instance separation than other state-of-the-art methods. In the future, we plan to improve our splitting process by selectively splitting at false splits and show skeleton-assisted segmentation methods too.
