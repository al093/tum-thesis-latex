\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

We developed an instance skeletonization method for 3D biomedical images and showed its efficacy on different modalities and complicated shapes.
We demonstrated our novel usage of topology of skeletons to resolve false merges which resulted in great improvement. While our method beats other state-of-the-art skeletonization approaches it still results in over-split skeletons. This means the splitting and tracking steps needs to be optimized further to achieve perfect results.
