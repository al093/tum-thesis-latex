\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

We developed an instance skeletonization method for 3D biomedical images and showed its efficacy on different modalities and complicated shapes.
We demonstrated that by using topology of skeletons false merges and splits can be resolved, and qualitatively also proved our hypothesis. Nevertheless, while our method beats other state-of-the-art skeletonization approaches it still results in over-split skeletons, hence requires further optimizations while splitting and tracking.
